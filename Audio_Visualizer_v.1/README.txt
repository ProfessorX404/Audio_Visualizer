To run, follow this guide: https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted to install Processing on your computer, then open your preferred version.
Press the triangular run button at the top left. You can also run in your preferred IDE (eg VSCode) with Processing plugin, however custom configuration
of launch files may be required.

To use audio clip with program, place .wav file named "sample.wav" in same directory as .pde build. Some sample audio clips have been provided in
directory for your use, however you must rename them when you place them in the respective directories. 

Version a: The effects work better on music rather than speech.

Version b: The effects are more dramatic with speech than in a, however some music can become just a jumbled mess. 

Note: both versions work with both, however each is suited for one format more than the other. 

!! DO NOT RUN WITHOUT sample.wav FILE --THE PROGRAM WILL HARD CRASH !!
